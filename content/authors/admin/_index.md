I am a nanofabrication engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I work on designing, engineering, and fabricating microdevices. My research interests are at the intersection of semiconductor processing, photonics design and simulation, and packaging. I am passionate about working on the next generation of micro and nanotechnologies and their implementation for real-world devices.
